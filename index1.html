    <section class="about-me">
        <p> I am currently training as a full stack developer through the Black Codher Bootcamp. I am a Biomedical Science graduate who started my career as a microbiologist and more recently switched to working within the NHS as a performance analyst. I hope to marry my interest into tech and healthcare to build meaningful projects. </p>
